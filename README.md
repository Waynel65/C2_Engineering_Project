# C2_Engineering_Project

## C2 Folder: ##

    - Contains all the files related to the server side of the project
    - A virtual environment is available in the folder
        - Use `source c2_env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
        - to install new packages use pip3
        - run python files with python3
        - start running the server with `python3 c2_server.py` (apparently there is NO need to export and the set flask_env=development for now)
        - run the client with `python3 c2_client.py`
